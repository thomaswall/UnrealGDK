# Cross-server RPCs
<%(TOC)%>

In native-Unreal networking, [RPCs (Unreal documentation)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/RPCs) are functions which either the client or the server use to send messages to each other over a network connection. 

Cross-server RPCs are a custom solution to take advantage of the SpatialOS distributed server architecture.

In Unreal’s native single-client architecture, your game server holds the canonical state of the whole game world. As there is a single game server, it has complete authority over all server Actors and so it is able to invoke and execute functions on Actors unhindered. 

In SpatialOS games, there can be more than one server; these multiple servers are known as “server-workers”. (Find out more about server-workers as well as “client-workers” in the [glossary]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#workers).) As a SpatialOS game runs across many server-workers, SpatialOS server-workers have the concept of “worker authority” - where only one server-worker at a time is able to invoke and execute functions on Actors. (Find out more about authority in the [glossary]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#authority).)

As Unreal expects there to be only one server, rather than several servers, the GDK has a custom solution to take advantage of the SpatialOS distributed server architecture. This involves handling the scenario where a server-worker attempts to invoke an RPC on an Actor that another server-worker has [authority]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#workers) over. This custom solution is the cross-server RPC. The GDK offers cross-server RPC in addition to support for the [native RPC types that Unreal provides (Unreal documentation)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/RPCs).

When a cross-server RPC is invoked by a non-authoritative server-worker, SpatialOS routes the execution through the SpatialOS [Runtime]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#spatialos-runtime) to the authoritative server-worker - this authoritative server-worker executes the RPC.

The example diagram below shows a player successfully shooting another player’s hat across a server-worker boundary.

In the diagram, Server-worker 1 has authority over Player 1 and Server-worker 2 has authority over Player 2. If Player 1 shoots a bullet, Server-worker 1 knows about the bullet and can make any necessary changes to Player 1 but it can’t make changes to Player 2 when the bullet hits. SpatialOS ensures that Server-worker 2 can make changes to Player 2 (the hat gets hit by the bullet) by routing the change notification from Server-worker 1 to Server-worker 2.

### How to send a cross-server RPC (using C++)

To set up a cross-server RPC, follow the same instructions as you would for [marking up RPCs (Unreal documentation)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/RPCs) within Unreal.

1. Add a `CrossServer` tag to the `UFUNCTION` macro of the RPC function that you want to be cross-server on your Actor (`MyActor` in this example).

    ```
    UFUNCTION(CrossServer, Reliable, WithValidation)
    void MyCrossServerRPC();
    ```

    Note: `WithValidation` is optional.

1. Add the related function implementations:
    ```
    void MyActor::MyCrossServerRPC_Implementation()
    {
        // Implementation goes here...
    }
   ```
   Note: You may need to implement the `MyCrossServerRPC_Validation()` if you used the `WithValidation` attribute.

1. Invoke the `CrossServer` RPC function as you would with any other function.

### How to send a cross-server RPC (using Blueprints)

To set up a cross-server RPC in a Blueprint, follow the same instructions as you would for [marking up RPCs in Blueprints (Unreal documentation)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/RPCs#blueprints), but from the **Replicates** drop-down list within the **Details** panel of your event, select **Run on authoritative server (sent from server)**:

### Execution notes

The tables below show where cross-server RPCs are executed based on where they were invoked. (To make it easier to follow, the tables use the same format as the [Unreal documentation on RPCs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/RPCs#rpcinvokedfromtheserver).)

#### Invoking a cross-server RPC from an authoritative server-worker

| **Actor ownership** | **Cross-server RPC**
|-----------|---------
| Client-owned Actor | Runs on the authoritative server-worker
| Server-owned Actor | Runs on the authoritative server-worker
| Unowned Actor | Runs on the authoritative server-worker

#### Invoking a cross-server RPC from a client-worker

| **Actor ownership** | **Cross-server RPC**
|-----------|---------
| Owned by invoking client | Runs on invoking client-worker
| Owned by a different client | Runs on invoking client-worker
| Server-owned Actor | Runs on invoking client-worker
| Unowned Actor | Runs on invoking client-worker
